# Homework6 (TV Gifs)

Howdy partners!

This project is a tool I created during the third week of my coding bootcamp with Trilogy at UC Berkeley Extension to practice AJAX calls.

Upon going to the site, the user will see a few default options for TV shows to search giphy's API. By pressing one of the buttons, the user will see ten GIFs and some information about them. A text input below the buttons allows the user to input their own search term (preferably a TV show) and it will create a new button for the user to try.

Each of the GIFs have the functionality to switch between a still image and an animated image, simulating a pause/play feature. This is done by using jQuery to switch the attributes of each image between the two versions of the image.

It is all created by yours truly, Marlon Jovez, with the inspiration of the program and our teacher, David Hallinan. Feel free to reach me for questions at emjovbusiness@gmail.com
